FEWD assignment 1

## About Me:

Hello, I'm Jeremy McKay.  I am in the Front End Web Development program at San Diego Continuing Education.  The course is great and I am learning a lot about Web Development and Design.  During the first half of the program, I was in a group and we created a website based on a existing site.  This is what my group came up with [www.jeremymckay.com/pages/py](http://www.jeremymckay.com/pages/py).

## Fun things I like to do:
* Play with my Dog
* Play PC games with my kids
* Hike at Mission Trails
* Go camping

I use to mountain bike as well and loved going on vacation to ride my bike in different places. Here is a picture of me in Sedona.
